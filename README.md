# House-Sales_in_King_Count_USA
In this work we analyse and predict housing prices using attributes or features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, 
number of floors and so on. A templet notebook is provided in the lab; my job is to complete the ten questions. 
Some hints to the questions are given in the templet notebook.
